        This is the constructor for the Trajectory object. A fresh trajectory
        object will be constructed before each mission. For a waypoint
        trajectory, the input argument is an array of 3D destination
        coordinates. You are free to choose the times of arrival and the path
        taken between the points in any way you like.

        You should initialize parameters and pre-compute values such as
        polynomial coefficients here.

        Inputs:
            points, (N, 3) array of N waypoint coordinates in 3D
